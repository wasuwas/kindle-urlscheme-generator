[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
